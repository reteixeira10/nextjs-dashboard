This web application is a dashboard app built with the Next.js framework, specifically using the App Router architecture (as seen from the app directory structure and usage of server components). Here are the key details:




Framework

Next.js (latest, v15.x, as per package.json)
Uses the App Router (app directory, server components, layouts, etc.)
Supports server-side rendering, static generation, and API routes.




Main Libraries & Dependencies

React (latest, v19.x)
next-auth (v5.x, beta): For authentication.
postgres: For connecting to a PostgreSQL database.
bcrypt: For password hashing.
zod: For schema validation.
@heroicons/react: For icons.
tailwindcss: For styling.
clsx: For conditional class names.
use-debounce: For debounced input handling (e.g., search).
